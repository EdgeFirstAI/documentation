# CLI Reference

Complete command reference for `edgefirst-client`. For getting started, see the [CLI introduction](index.md).

edgefirst-client - Command-line interface for EdgeFirst Studio MLOps platform

**Synopsis:** `edgefirst-client` \[*OPTIONS*\] *COMMAND*
`edgefirst-client` is a command-line tool for interacting with EdgeFirst Studio, an MLOps platform for 3D/4D spatial perception AI. It provides comprehensive dataset management, training workflow orchestration, and artifact handling capabilities.

Install the CLI and Python API together with:

```bash
pip install edgefirst-client
```

This places both the `edgefirst-client` executable and the **edgefirst_client** Python module on your PATH (inside a virtual environment, use `python -m venv .venv` first). See [Python tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) for tutorials.

The client supports various authentication methods including environment variables, configuration files, and command-line options. Authentication tokens are cached in the OS-specific configuration directory for persistent sessions.

## Global options

`--server` *SERVER*
:   EdgeFirst Studio server name. Maps to `https://{SERVER}.edgefirst.studio`, except "saas" or empty which maps to `https://edgefirst.studio`. Can be set via **STUDIO_SERVER** environment variable.

    **Server Selection Priority:**

    1. **Token's server** (highest) - JWT tokens encode their server. If you have a valid stored or provided token, its server is used regardless of `--server`.
    2. `--server` option - Used when logging in with username/password, or when no token is available. If a token exists with a different server, a warning is displayed.
    3. **Default "saas"** - If no token and no server specified, the production server is used.

`--username` *USERNAME*
:   EdgeFirst Studio username for authentication. Can be set via **STUDIO_USERNAME** environment variable.

`--password` *PASSWORD*
:   EdgeFirst Studio password for authentication. Can be set via **STUDIO_PASSWORD** environment variable.

`--token` *TOKEN*
:   EdgeFirst Studio authentication token. Can be set via **STUDIO_TOKEN** environment variable. The server is extracted from the token and takes priority over `--server`.

`--token-path` *TOKEN_PATH*
:   Path to the token file, overriding the default platform-specific location. Useful for testing or running multiple instances with different tokens. Can be set via **STUDIO_TOKEN_PATH** environment variable.

**-v**, `--verbose`
:   Increase logging verbosity. Repeatable: `-v` enables debug logging and `-vv` enables trace logging. Applies to all commands.

`--trace-file` *TRACE_FILE*
:   Write trace output to a file. The format is determined by the extension: `.json` for Chrome JSON format (viewable in the Perfetto UI) or `.pftrace` for native Perfetto format. Requires a build with the `trace-file` feature. Can be set via **TRACE_FILE** environment variable.

**-h**, `--help`
:   Print help information.

**-V**, `--version`
:   Print version information.

## Authentication

### `server-version`

Returns the EdgeFirst Studio server version and the client version. Does not require authentication.

**edgefirst-client server-version**

Note: this command was named `version` prior to 2.12.0. That name now refers to the dataset-versioning subcommand group (`tag`, `changelog`, `current`, `summary`; `restore` lives under `version tag restore`) — see [Dataset versioning](#dataset-versioning).

### `login`

Login to the EdgeFirst Studio server. The authentication token is stored in the application configuration file for subsequent commands.

`edgefirst-client` [`--server` *SERVER*] **login**

When `--username` and `--password` are omitted, the CLI prompts for them interactively (recommended). Do not pass passwords on the command line.

Optional flags `--username` and `--password` exist for non-interactive automation; prefer **STUDIO_TOKEN** or **STUDIO_USERNAME** / **STUDIO_PASSWORD** environment variables for scripts instead.

Token storage locations:

- Linux: `~/.config/edgefirststudio/token`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ai.EdgeFirst.EdgeFirst-Studio/token`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\EdgeFirst\EdgeFirst Studio\config\token`

After CLI login, Python code can reuse the cached token with a bare `Client()` call, which loads the same file-backed token automatically. See [Tutorial 1](../tutorials/01_authentication.md). Passing credentials or storage options as constructor keywords (`Client(username=..., password=...)`, `Client(token=...)`, `Client(use_token_file=False)`) is the deprecated pre-2.6.0 style and now emits a `DeprecationWarning`; prefer the builder pattern (`Client().with_login(...)`, `Client().with_token(...)`, `Client().with_memory_storage()`) for new code.

### `logout`

Logout by removing the authentication token from the application configuration file.

**edgefirst-client logout**

### `token`

Returns the EdgeFirst Studio authentication token for the provided username and password. This is typically stored in the **STUDIO_TOKEN** environment variable for subsequent commands to avoid re-entering credentials.

`edgefirst-client` `--username` *USERNAME* `--password` *PASSWORD* **token**

Example:

```bash
export STUDIO_TOKEN=$(edgefirst-client --username user --password pass token)
```

## Organization

### `organization`

Show the authenticated user's organization information.

**edgefirst-client organization**

Displays organization name, ID, and other metadata.

## Projects

### `projects`

**edgefirst-client projects** \[`--name` *NAME*\]

**Options:**

`--name` *NAME*
:   Filter projects by name (case-insensitive substring match).

### `project`

Retrieve detailed information for a specific project.

**edgefirst-client project** *PROJECT_ID*

**Arguments:**

*PROJECT_ID*
:   The unique identifier of the project.

## Datasets

### `datasets`

List all datasets available to the authenticated user. If a project ID is provided, only datasets for that project are listed.

**edgefirst-client datasets** \[*OPTIONS*\] \[*PROJECT_ID*\]

**Arguments:**

*PROJECT_ID*

## Dataset operations

### `download-dataset`

Download a dataset to the local filesystem from the EdgeFirst Studio server.

**edgefirst-client download-dataset** \[*OPTIONS*\] \[*DATASET_ID*\]

**Arguments:**

*DATASET_ID*
:   The unique identifier of the dataset to download. Optional when `--list-types` is used.

**Options:**

`--groups` *GROUPS*
:   Only fetch samples belonging to the provided dataset groups (comma-separated list).

`--types` *TYPES*
:   Fetch specific data types for the dataset (comma-separated list). Default: **image**.
    Valid types: `image`, `lidar.pcd`, `lidar.png`, `lidar.jpg`, `radar.pcd`, `radar.png`, `all`. Use `all` to download every sensor type.

`--output` *OUTPUT*
:   Output directory path. If not provided, downloads to the current working directory.

`--flatten`
:   Download all files to the output directory without creating sequence subdirectories.
    When enabled, filenames are automatically prefixed to avoid conflicts between sequences.
    The prefix format is `{sequence_name}_{frame}_` when the frame number is available,
    and `{sequence_name}_` when the frame number is not available. Default: creates subdirectories for sequences.

`--tag` *TAG*
:   Download files from the specified tagged version instead of the current HEAD state. The tag must exist for the dataset. When omitted, downloads the current live data.

`--list-types`
:   List all valid sensor types and exit. *DATASET_ID* is not required when this flag is used.

**Example:**

```bash
# Download only images to specific directory
edgefirst-client download-dataset 12345 \
    --types image --output ./my-dataset

# Download multiple types with group filtering
edgefirst-client download-dataset 12345 \
    --types image,lidar.pcd --groups train,validation \
    --output /data/datasets/

# Download with flattened directory structure
# Files from sequences are prefixed with sequence_name_frame_
edgefirst-client download-dataset 12345 \
    --types image --output ./flat-dataset --flatten

# Download from a tagged version for reproducible training
edgefirst-client download-dataset 12345 \
    --tag v1.0 --types image --output ./versioned-data

# Public Coffee Cup dataset (SaaS)
edgefirst-client download-dataset ds-145f --groups val --types image \
    --output ./coffee_cup_images/
```

See [Tutorial 5](../tutorials/05_download_dataset.md).

**Directory Structure:**

By default, downloads are organized by sequence:

```text
output/
├── sequence_A/
│   ├── sequence_A_001.camera.jpeg
│   └── sequence_A_002.camera.jpeg
└── sequence_B/
    ├── sequence_B_001.camera.jpeg
    └── sequence_B_002.camera.jpeg
```

With `--flatten`, all files are placed in the output root with sequence prefixes:

```text
output/
├── sequence_A_001.camera.jpeg
├── sequence_A_002.camera.jpeg
├── sequence_B_001.camera.jpeg
└── sequence_B_002.camera.jpeg
```

### `download-annotations`

Download dataset annotations to a local file. This command accompanies **download-dataset** and is used to download the annotations rather than the dataset file samples (images, radar, lidar, etc.).

**edgefirst-client download-annotations** \[*OPTIONS*\] *ANNOTATION_SET_ID* *OUTPUT*

**Arguments:**

*ANNOTATION_SET_ID*
:   The unique identifier of the annotation set to download.

*OUTPUT*
:   Output file path. The format is determined by the file extension:
    - **.json** - COCO-style JSON format
    - **.arrow** - EdgeFirst Dataset Format (Apache Arrow)

**Options:**

`--groups` *GROUPS*
:   Only fetch samples belonging to the provided dataset groups (comma-separated list).

`--types` *TYPES*
:   Annotation types to download (comma-separated list). If omitted, all annotation types are downloaded. Supported types: box2d, box3d, polygon, raster. For backward compatibility `mask` and `seg` are accepted as aliases for `polygon` — note that `mask` therefore selects vector polygons, **not** raster masks; use `raster` for raster pixel masks. There is no `polyline` or `keypoint` annotation type; an unrecognized value is rejected with an error listing the accepted types.

`--tag` *TAG*
:   Download annotations from the specified tagged version instead of the current HEAD state. The tag must exist for the annotation set's dataset.

**Example:**

```bash
# Download 2D bounding boxes as JSON
edgefirst-client download-annotations 54321 annotations.json \
    --types box2d

# Download all annotation types in Arrow format
edgefirst-client download-annotations 54321 annotations.arrow \
    --types box2d,box3d,mask --groups train

# Download annotations from a tagged version
edgefirst-client download-annotations 54321 annotations.arrow \
    --tag v1.0 --types box2d

# Coffee Cup public dataset (resolve annotation set ID from dataset command)
edgefirst-client download-annotations <as-id> coffee_cup.arrow --groups val
```

For Arrow format documentation, see the [EdgeFirst Dataset Format](../../datasets/format/index.md).

Python: load with `polars.read_ipc()` or `client.samples_dataframe()` — see [Tutorial 4](../tutorials/04_polars_dataframe.md).

### `upload-dataset`

Upload samples to a dataset from images and/or Arrow annotations file. Supports flexible workflows: images-only, annotations-only, or both.

**edgefirst-client upload-dataset** \[*OPTIONS*\] *DATASET_ID*

**Arguments:**

*DATASET_ID*
:   Dataset ID to upload samples to.

**Options:**

`--annotations` *ANNOTATIONS*
:   Path to Arrow file with annotations (EdgeFirst Dataset Format). If omitted, only images will be uploaded.

`--images` *IMAGES*
:   Path to folder or ZIP containing images. If omitted, auto-discovers based on Arrow filename or "dataset" convention.

`--annotation-set-id` *ANNOTATION_SET_ID*
:   Annotation Set ID for the annotations. Required if Arrow file contains annotations.

**Image Discovery (when \--images not provided):**

The tool automatically searches for images in the following order:

1. Folder named after Arrow file (e.g., `data/` for `data.arrow`)
2. Folder named `dataset/`
3. ZIP file with same basename (e.g., `data.zip` for `data.arrow`)
4. `dataset.zip`

**Examples:**

```bash
# Upload images only
edgefirst-client upload-dataset 12345 --images ./photos/

# Upload Arrow annotations with auto-discovered images
edgefirst-client upload-dataset 12345 \
    --annotations dataset.arrow \
    --annotation-set-id 54321

# Upload both with explicit paths
edgefirst-client upload-dataset 12345 \
    --annotations labels.arrow \
    --images ./images/ \
    --annotation-set-id 54321
```

**Note:** Uploads are batched (50 samples per batch, so a failed batch only requires retrying 50 samples) with progress tracking. Batch concurrency defaults to 4 and is configurable via **EDGEFIRST_UPLOAD_BATCHES**. Arrow files must conform to the EdgeFirst Dataset Format.

**Note:** Annotations flagged `ignore` or `exclude` are dropped before upload and reported once as `⚠ Skipping N annotations flagged ignore/exclude: Studio does not support these flags yet`, since EdgeFirst Studio does not store these flags yet.

### `update-dimensions`

Backfill missing image width/height metadata for an existing dataset. Useful for datasets uploaded before the client started extracting image dimensions at upload time, or for samples where dimensions could not be determined.

**edgefirst-client update-dimensions** *DATASET_ID*

**Arguments:**

*DATASET_ID*
:   The unique identifier of the dataset to backfill. Accepts integer IDs or the **ds-xxx** form shown in the Web UI.

**Behavior:**

1. Fetches every sample in the dataset and filters to those missing **width** or **height**. If none are missing, the command prints `Updated dimensions for 0 samples` and exits successfully.
2. For each remaining sample, downloads the associated image, extracts the pixel dimensions locally, and queues a `(sample_id, width, height)` update. Samples that lack an image URL, return a non-success HTTP status (e.g. `404`, `500`), or cannot be parsed as a recognized image format are skipped silently — the command continues with the next sample.
3. Sends queued updates to the server in batches of **500** via the `samples.update_dimensions` JSON-RPC method.

**Progress output:**

Progress is reported on stdout in the form:

```text
[CURRENT/TOTAL] Computing dimensions
```

`TOTAL` is the count of samples missing dimensions (not the full dataset), and `CURRENT` advances once per sample processed (including skipped ones). A final summary line is printed when the operation completes:

```text
Updated dimensions for N samples
```

`N` is the count returned by the server — the number of samples actually updated, which may be less than `TOTAL` if some samples were skipped.

**Example:**

```bash
# Backfill dimensions for a legacy dataset
edgefirst-client update-dimensions 12345

# Using the ds- form
edgefirst-client update-dimensions ds-12345
```

**Notes:**

- This is a **one-time repair operation**. After it completes, the dataset's sample width/height columns are populated server-side and subsequent calls will report `Updated dimensions for 0 samples`.
- The operation downloads each image in serial, so runtime scales linearly with the number of samples missing dimensions and the size of those images. For very large datasets, run the command from a host with good bandwidth to the EdgeFirst Studio object store.
- Equivalent programmatic APIs:
    - **Rust:** `Client::backfill_sample_dimensions(dataset_id, progress)` (and `Client::update_sample_dimensions` for already-known dimensions).
    - **Python:** `client.backfill_sample_dimensions(dataset_id, progress=cb)`.

### `delete-samples`

Delete one or more samples (images) from a dataset.

**edgefirst-client delete-samples** *DATASET_ID* *SAMPLE_IDS*...

**Arguments:**

*DATASET_ID*
:   The unique identifier of the dataset the samples belong to.

*SAMPLE_IDS*
:   One or more sample (image) IDs to delete.

**Example:**

```bash
edgefirst-client delete-samples 12345 1001 1002
```

**Note:** Annotations belonging to the deleted samples are removed automatically by the server (cascade delete) — no separate step is needed. Deletion is asynchronous on the server: the command returns once the request is accepted, before the delete has actually completed, so samples may not disappear from subsequent queries immediately.

## Dataset versioning

The `version` subcommand group manages dataset version tags, changelog inspection, and dataset restore. Every dataset modification is recorded with a monotonic serial number. Named tags capture the complete dataset state at a point in time, enabling reproducible training runs and controlled rollbacks.

**Key concepts:**

- **Serial** — Per-dataset monotonic counter that increments with each logged change.
- **Tag** — Named reference to a serial number and full database snapshot (images, annotations, labels, annotation sets, sensor data).
- **Changelog** — Append-only audit trail of every dataset modification.

Tag names may contain alphanumeric characters, dots, dashes, and underscores (e.g., `v1.0`, `training-2026-04`, `baseline_v3`).

### `version tag create`

Create a named version tag capturing the current dataset state.

**edgefirst-client version tag create** *DATASET* *NAME* [*OPTIONS*]

**Arguments:**

*DATASET*
:   Dataset identifier (ID string, for example `ds-1a2b3c`).

*NAME*
:   Tag name. Allowed characters: alphanumeric, `.`, `-`, `_`. Max 100 characters. Case-sensitive.

**Options:**

**-d**, `--description` *DESCRIPTION*
:   Human-readable description for the tag.

**Example:**

```bash
# Tag current dataset state for a training run
edgefirst-client version tag create ds-1a2b3c v1.0 -d "Initial production dataset"

# Tag using dataset name
edgefirst-client version tag create "My Dataset" training-2026-04
```

### `version tag list`

List all version tags for a dataset, ordered by serial number (most recent first).

**edgefirst-client version tag list** *DATASET*

**Example:**

```bash
edgefirst-client version tag list ds-1a2b3c
```

### `version tag get`

Show detailed information for a specific version tag.

**edgefirst-client version tag get** *DATASET* *NAME*

**Example:**

```bash
edgefirst-client version tag get ds-1a2b3c v1.0
```

### `version tag delete`

Delete a version tag and its snapshot data. This operation is irreversible.

**edgefirst-client version tag delete** *DATASET* *NAME*

**Example:**

```bash
edgefirst-client version tag delete ds-1a2b3c v1.0-draft
```

### `version tag restore`

Restore a dataset to the state captured by a version tag. All changes made after the tag are discarded. The tag itself is preserved and can be restored again.

**edgefirst-client version tag restore** *DATASET* *NAME*

**Example:**

```bash
edgefirst-client version tag restore ds-1a2b3c v1.0
```

### `version changelog`

Show changelog entries for a dataset. Accepts serial numbers or tag names as range boundaries.

**edgefirst-client version changelog** *DATASET* [*OPTIONS*]

**Options:**

`--from` *VERSION*
:   Start of the range (tag name or serial number, inclusive). Defaults to the beginning of the changelog.

`--to` *VERSION*
:   End of the range (tag name or serial number, inclusive). Defaults to the current serial.

`--types` *TYPES*
:   Filter by entity types (comma-separated). Valid values: `image`, `annotation`, `label`, `annotation_set`, `sensor_data`, `dataset`.

`--limit` *LIMIT*
:   Maximum number of entries to return. Default: **100**.

**Example:**

```bash
# Show all recent changelog entries
edgefirst-client version changelog ds-1a2b3c

# Show changes between two tags
edgefirst-client version changelog ds-1a2b3c --from v1.0 --to v2.0

# Show only annotation changes since a specific serial
edgefirst-client version changelog ds-1a2b3c --from 10 --types annotation

# Show the 50 most recent entries
edgefirst-client version changelog ds-1a2b3c --limit 50
```

### `version current`

Show the current version information for a dataset: serial number, all tags, and a dataset summary.

**edgefirst-client version current** *DATASET*

**Example:**

```bash
edgefirst-client version current ds-1a2b3c
```

### `version summary`

Show cached dataset metrics: image count, annotation counts by type, label count, and annotation set count.

**edgefirst-client version summary** *DATASET*

**Example:**

```bash
edgefirst-client version summary ds-1a2b3c
```

## Snapshots

Dataset snapshots preserve a complete copy of raw sensor data (MCAP files), directories, or EdgeFirst Dataset Format data at a specific point in time. They can be restored to create new datasets with optional automatic annotation (AGTG) and depth map generation.

For detailed information about snapshots, see: [Dataset Snapshots](../../studio/snapshots.md).

### `snapshots`

List all snapshots available to the authenticated user.

**edgefirst-client snapshots**

Displays snapshot ID, dataset reference, creation date, and username.

### `snapshot`

Retrieve detailed information for a specific snapshot.

**edgefirst-client snapshot** *SNAPSHOT_ID*

**Arguments:**

*SNAPSHOT_ID*
:   The unique identifier of the snapshot (format: **ss-xxx**).

### `create-snapshot`

Create a new snapshot from a local file/directory or from an existing server-side dataset. Smart argument interpretation automatically detects the source type.

**edgefirst-client create-snapshot** \[*OPTIONS*\] *SOURCE*

**Arguments:**

*SOURCE*
:   Source for the snapshot. Automatically interpreted based on format:
    - **ds-xxx**: Dataset ID (creates snapshot from server dataset)
    - **as-xxx**: Annotation Set ID (creates snapshot from parent dataset)
    - **path/to/file.mcap**: Local MCAP file upload
    - **path/to/folder/**: Local directory upload (pre-validated against the EdgeFirst Dataset Format; structural errors abort with a hint to run `generate-arrow`, lesser issues only warn)
    - **path/to/file.arrow** with a same-basename **path/to/file.zip** sibling in the same directory: uploaded together as a paired EdgeFirst Dataset Format source
    - **path/to/file.zip** (no matching **.arrow** sibling): Local ZIP file upload

**Options:**

`--annotation-set` *ANNOTATION_SET*
:   When SOURCE is a dataset ID, optionally specify an annotation set ID (format: **as-xxx**) to include in the snapshot. If not provided, the default "annotations" set is used, or the first available annotation set if no default exists.

**-d, \--description** *DESCRIPTION*
:   Custom description for the snapshot. If not provided, auto-generates from source name and current date/time.

`--from-path`
:   Explicitly treat SOURCE as a local file path (overrides auto-detection).

`--from-dataset`
:   Explicitly treat SOURCE as a dataset ID (overrides auto-detection).

**-m, \--monitor**
:   Monitor the task progress until completion (server-side creation only).

**Example:**

```bash
# Create snapshot from server dataset (auto-detected by ds- prefix)
edgefirst-client create-snapshot ds-12345

# Create snapshot with specific annotation set
edgefirst-client create-snapshot ds-12345 --annotation-set as-67890

# Create snapshot with custom description
edgefirst-client create-snapshot ds-12345 --description "Deer Dataset Backup"

# Create from annotation set (auto-detected by as- prefix, looks up parent dataset)
edgefirst-client create-snapshot as-abc123

# Create from server dataset and wait for completion
edgefirst-client create-snapshot ds-12345 --monitor

# Upload local MCAP file (auto-detected by file extension)
edgefirst-client create-snapshot ./recording.mcap

# Upload local directory
edgefirst-client create-snapshot ./sensor_data/

# Upload local ZIP file
edgefirst-client create-snapshot ./dataset.zip

# Explicitly specify source type
edgefirst-client create-snapshot ds-12345 --from-dataset
edgefirst-client create-snapshot ./my_data --from-path
```

**Note:** Server-side creation runs asynchronously. Use `--monitor` to wait for completion, or check status later with `edgefirst-client task <TASK_ID>`. Local uploads display progress during transfer.

### `download-snapshot`

Download a snapshot to a local directory.

**edgefirst-client download-snapshot** \[*OPTIONS*\] `--output` *OUTPUT* *SNAPSHOT_ID*

**Arguments:**

*SNAPSHOT_ID*
:   The unique identifier of the snapshot (format: **ss-xxx**).

**Options:**

`--output` *OUTPUT*
:   Output directory path where snapshot contents will be downloaded (required).

**Example:**

```bash
# Download snapshot
edgefirst-client download-snapshot ss-abc123 --output ./snapshot_data/
```

### `restore-snapshot`

Restore a snapshot to a dataset in a project. Supports MCAP uploads with optional AGTG (auto-annotation) and automatic depth map generation for compatible camera data.

**edgefirst-client restore-snapshot** \[*OPTIONS*\] *PROJECT_ID* *SNAPSHOT_ID*

**Arguments:**

*PROJECT_ID*
:   The project ID to restore the snapshot into.

*SNAPSHOT_ID*
:   The unique identifier of the snapshot to restore (format: **ss-xxx**).

**Options:**

`--topics` *TOPICS*
:   MCAP topics to include (comma-separated). Empty means all topics.

`--autolabel` *AUTOLABEL*
:   Object labels for AGTG auto-annotation (comma-separated, e.g. `person,car`). Empty means no AGTG. Requires compatible sensor data and trained models.

`--autodepth`
:   Generate depth maps. Maivin/Raivin cameras only.

`--dataset-name` *DATASET_NAME*
:   Custom name for the restored dataset.

`--dataset-description` *DATASET_DESCRIPTION*
:   Description for the restored dataset.

`--monitor`
:   Monitor the restore task progress until completion.

**Example:**

```bash
# Basic restore into a project
edgefirst-client restore-snapshot p-abc123 ss-def456

# Restore with AGTG auto-annotation for the given labels
edgefirst-client restore-snapshot p-abc123 ss-def456 --autolabel person,car

# Restore with AGTG and depth generation, with a custom name, and wait for completion
edgefirst-client restore-snapshot p-abc123 ss-def456 \
    --autolabel person,car --autodepth \
    --dataset-name "Field Test Restore" --monitor
```

**Note:** Restoration creates a new dataset. The original snapshot remains unchanged and can be restored multiple times. AGTG processing runs asynchronously — use `--monitor`, or check task status, for completion.

For more information about AGTG, see: [Automatic Ground Truth Generation](../../studio/agtg.md).

### `delete-snapshot`

Delete a snapshot permanently. This operation cannot be undone.

**edgefirst-client delete-snapshot** *SNAPSHOT_ID*

**Arguments:**

*SNAPSHOT_ID*
:   The unique identifier of the snapshot to delete (format: **ss-xxx**).

**Example:**

```bash
edgefirst-client delete-snapshot ss-abc123
```

**Warning:** Deletion is permanent. Ensure the snapshot is no longer needed before deleting.

### `generate-arrow`

Generate an Arrow annotation file from a folder of images. This is useful for importing existing image collections into EdgeFirst Dataset Format.

**edgefirst-client generate-arrow** \[*OPTIONS*\] `--output` *OUTPUT* *FOLDER*

The command will:

1. Scan the folder recursively for image files (JPEG, PNG)
2. Optionally detect sequence patterns (name_frame.ext)
3. Create an Arrow file with the current 2026.10 schema and null annotations

**Arguments:**

*FOLDER*
:   Folder containing images to process. The command scans recursively for supported image formats.

**Options:**

**-o, \--output** *OUTPUT*
:   Output Arrow file path (required). The file will be created with the EdgeFirst Dataset Format schema.

`--detect-sequences`
:   Detect sequence patterns in filenames. Files matching patterns like `name_001.jpg`, `name_002.jpg` will be grouped into sequences.

**Example:**

```bash
# Generate Arrow file from images
edgefirst-client generate-arrow ./images --output dataset.arrow

# Generate with sequence detection
edgefirst-client generate-arrow ./images -o my_data/my_data.arrow --detect-sequences

# Create Arrow file for existing dataset structure
edgefirst-client generate-arrow ./sensor_data/camera/ --output ./sensor_data/my_data.arrow
```

**Note:** The generated Arrow file contains null annotations for each image. Use EdgeFirst Studio to add annotations, or use `create-snapshot` to upload the directory to EdgeFirst Studio.

### `validate-snapshot`

Validate a snapshot directory structure against the EdgeFirst Dataset Format specification.

**edgefirst-client validate-snapshot** \[*OPTIONS*\] *PATH*

The command checks that the directory follows the EdgeFirst Dataset Format:

- Exactly one annotation file exists at the expected location (`<name>.arrow` or `<name>.parquet`)
- Sensor container directory exists (e.g., `camera/`, `lidar/`)
- All files referenced in the annotation file exist on disk

**Arguments:**

*PATH*
:   Snapshot directory to validate. The directory basename must match its Arrow or Parquet annotation filename and sibling sensor container.

**Options:**

`validate-snapshot` takes no options of its own. Detailed output (warnings and informational messages beyond the first 5 of each kind) is controlled by the global **-v**, `--verbose` flag documented under [Global options](#global-options), not a command-local flag — pass it anywhere on the command line.

**Example:**

```bash
# Validate a snapshot directory
edgefirst-client validate-snapshot ./my_dataset

# Validate with detailed output (global -v flag)
edgefirst-client -v validate-snapshot ./my_dataset

# Validate before uploading
edgefirst-client validate-snapshot ./sensor_data && edgefirst-client create-snapshot ./sensor_data
```

**Exit codes:**

- **0**: Validation passed (warnings may be present)
- **1**: Validation failed with errors

## COCO interchange

Tools for converting between the COCO (Common Objects in Context) annotation format and the EdgeFirst Dataset Format, and for importing and exporting COCO datasets directly to and from EdgeFirst Studio. These commands support bounding boxes, polygon segmentation, and RLE segmentation. RLE masks are stored as PNG-encoded raster data in the EdgeFirst `mask` column.

For details on the [EdgeFirst Dataset Format](../../datasets/format/index.md) and its COCO mapping.

### `coco-to-arrow`

Convert COCO annotations to the EdgeFirst Dataset Format. The input may be one COCO annotation JSON file, a ZIP archive, or a standard extracted COCO directory. For a directory, all `instances_*.json` files are combined into one output and split names such as `train` and `val` are inferred into the sample-level `group` column. Referenced images can be staged alongside the annotation file for a complete offline dataset.

**edgefirst-client coco-to-arrow** \[*OPTIONS*\] `--output` *OUTPUT* *COCO_PATH*

**Arguments:**

*COCO_PATH*
:   Path to a COCO annotation file (JSON), ZIP archive, or extracted COCO root. A standard root contains `annotations/instances_train*.json`, `annotations/instances_val*.json`, and matching image directories such as `train2017/` and `val2017/`.

**Options:**

**-o, \--output** *OUTPUT*
:   Output annotation file path (required). Format is chosen by extension: `.parquet` writes Apache Parquet, anything else (including `.arrow`) writes Arrow IPC. Both carry the same file-level metadata (`schema_version`, `category_metadata`, `labels`).

`--masks` *MASKS*
:   Include segmentation masks. Defaults to **true**; pass `--masks=false` to convert bounding boxes only. [possible values: true, false]

`--group` *GROUP*
:   Group name applied to all samples (e.g. `train`, `val`). Use this for a single JSON/ZIP input. On a directory input it overrides inferred split groups for every discovered annotation file; omit it to preserve train/val.

`--images` *IMAGES*
:   Stage referenced images into the EdgeFirst on-disk layout next to the output: for `<dir>/<stem>.arrow` or `.parquet`, images are copied into `<dir>/<stem>/`. With a directory input, pass the COCO root so split directories are resolved automatically. Missing images warn but do not fail conversion; re-running is idempotent.

`--link`
:   Symlink staged images instead of copying (requires `--images`). Saves disk space for large datasets.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Standard COCO train + val -> one offline Arrow dataset:
# coco/coco.arrow plus linked images in coco/coco/
edgefirst-client coco-to-arrow ~/Datasets/COCO \
  -o coco/coco.arrow --images ~/Datasets/COCO --link
edgefirst-client validate-snapshot coco

# The same combined dataset as Parquet
edgefirst-client coco-to-arrow ~/Datasets/COCO \
  -o coco-parquet/coco-parquet.parquet --images ~/Datasets/COCO --link
edgefirst-client validate-snapshot coco-parquet

# One split from a single JSON; --group assigns the split
edgefirst-client coco-to-arrow instances_val2017.json \
  -o val/val.arrow --images ~/Datasets/COCO/val2017 --group val

# Convert bounding boxes only (no segmentation)
edgefirst-client coco-to-arrow instances_val2017.json \
  -o val.parquet --masks=false --group val
```

Every image in each COCO `images` array produces at least one row. An image with no annotations is emitted as a placeholder row with a null label, preserving the image and its `group` so splits cover the full image set.

COCO crowd annotations (`iscrowd: 1`) are written with `ignore = true`, keeping their label and index; the deprecated `iscrowd` column is written as a mirror.

Load and filter the resulting groups with Polars:

```python
import polars as pl

df = pl.read_ipc("coco/coco.arrow")  # pl.read_parquet(...) for Parquet
train = df.filter(pl.col("group") == "train")
val = df.filter(pl.col("group") == "val")
```

### `arrow-to-coco`

Convert EdgeFirst Arrow IPC or Parquet annotations to COCO JSON, optionally filtered by group.

**edgefirst-client arrow-to-coco** \[*OPTIONS*\] `--output` *OUTPUT* *ARROW_PATH*

**Arguments:**

*ARROW_PATH*
:   Path to an EdgeFirst Arrow IPC or Parquet file.

**Options:**

**-o, \--output** *OUTPUT*
:   Output COCO JSON file path (required).

`--masks` *MASKS*
:   Include segmentation masks. Defaults to **true**; pass `--masks=false` for bounding boxes only. [possible values: true, false]

`--groups` *GROUPS*
:   Filter by group names (comma-separated, e.g. `train,val`). If omitted, all groups are exported.

`--pretty`
:   Pretty-print the JSON output.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Convert an Arrow dataset to COCO JSON
edgefirst-client arrow-to-coco dataset.arrow -o instances.json

# Export only the train and val splits, pretty-printed
edgefirst-client arrow-to-coco dataset.arrow -o instances.json --groups train,val --pretty
```

**Note:** COCO `iscrowd` is written from the `ignore` column (or a legacy `iscrowd` column). Rows flagged `exclude`, and `ignore` rows without a label, have no COCO equivalent and are skipped; one warning gives the count. `exclude` rows do not create a COCO category.

**Category ids:** COCO `category_id` is taken from `label_index` when present, unchanged. A dataset indexed from 0, such as a default `visdrone-to-arrow` conversion (`pedestrian` = 0), therefore produces `category_id` 0. Some COCO tools reserve 0 for background; remap the ids if your consumer does.

### `import-coco`

Import a COCO dataset directly into EdgeFirst Studio. Converts COCO annotations and uploads the images and annotations to a dataset. Create a new dataset automatically with `--name`, or target an existing dataset and annotation set.

COCO datasets must be extracted before import — ZIP archives are not supported directly. Extract the annotations and images first.

**edgefirst-client import-coco** \[*OPTIONS*\] *COCO_PATH*

**Arguments:**

*COCO_PATH*
:   Path to a COCO annotation JSON file or an extracted COCO directory.

**Options:**

**-p, \--project** *PROJECT*
:   Project ID. Required when creating a new dataset with `--name`.

**-n, \--name** *NAME*
:   Create a new dataset with this name (alternative to `--dataset`).

**-d, \--description** *DESCRIPTION*
:   Description for the new dataset (used with `--name`).

`--dataset` *DATASET*
:   Target dataset ID (alternative to `--name`).

`--annotation-set` *ANNOTATION_SET*
:   Target annotation set ID. Defaults to the dataset's first annotation set if not specified.

`--group` *GROUP*
:   Group name for the imported samples. Acts as a filter against the group auto-detected from each image's path/filename; if omitted, the detected group is used.

`--masks` *MASKS*
:   Include segmentation masks. Defaults to **true**; pass `--masks=false` for bounding boxes only. [possible values: true, false]

`--images` *IMAGES*
:   Include images in the upload. Defaults to **true**; pass `--images=false` to upload annotations only. [possible values: true, false]

`--batch-size` *BATCH_SIZE*
:   Number of samples per upload batch. [default: 100]

`--concurrency` *CONCURRENCY*
:   Maximum number of concurrent uploads. [default: 64]

`--verify`
:   Verify the import instead of uploading — compares the local COCO dataset against Studio and reports differences.

`--update`
:   Update annotations on existing samples without re-uploading images. Use this to add masks to samples imported without them, or to sync updated annotations to Studio.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a new dataset and import (group auto-detected from image folders)
edgefirst-client import-coco ./coco --project p-123 --name "COCO 2017"

# Import into an existing dataset and annotation set
edgefirst-client import-coco ./coco --dataset ds-123 --annotation-set as-456

# Import detection boxes only into an existing dataset
edgefirst-client import-coco ./coco/annotations/instances_train2017.json \
    --dataset ds-123 --annotation-set as-456 --masks=false

# Verify a previous import without uploading
edgefirst-client import-coco ./coco --dataset ds-123 --verify
```

**Note:** `--group` matches against the group EdgeFirst derives from each image's path; standard COCO files reference images by bare filename (e.g. `000000397133.jpg`) and therefore carry no detectable group, so passing a value that does not match excludes those images. To assign a split to images that have none, convert with `coco-to-arrow --group` and upload with `upload-dataset`.

**Note:** COCO crowd annotations (`iscrowd: 1`) map to the `ignore` flag, which EdgeFirst Studio does not store yet. Import and `--update` skip them and log one warning with the count, and `--verify` leaves them out of the expected COCO annotation count.

### `export-coco`

Export an EdgeFirst Studio dataset to COCO format. Downloads samples and annotations from Studio and converts them to COCO JSON, optionally bundling the images into a ZIP archive.

**edgefirst-client export-coco** \[*OPTIONS*\] `--output` *OUTPUT* *DATASET_ID* *ANNOTATION_SET_ID*

**Arguments:**

*DATASET_ID*
:   Source dataset ID in Studio.

*ANNOTATION_SET_ID*
:   Source annotation set ID.

**Options:**

**-o, \--output** *OUTPUT*
:   Output file path. Use a `.json` extension for annotations only, or `.zip` to bundle images (see `--images`).

`--groups` *GROUPS*
:   Filter by group names (comma-separated, e.g. `train,val`). If omitted, all groups are exported.

`--masks` *MASKS*
:   Include segmentation masks. Defaults to **true**; pass `--masks=false` for bounding boxes only. [possible values: true, false]

`--images`
:   Include images in the output. This produces a ZIP archive containing both the COCO JSON and the image files.

`--pretty`
:   Pretty-print the JSON output.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Export annotations to COCO JSON
edgefirst-client export-coco ds-123 as-456 -o instances.json

# Export the train and val splits with images as a ZIP bundle
edgefirst-client export-coco ds-123 as-456 -o coco.zip --images --groups train,val
```

### `migrate`

Migrate an Arrow file from an older schema to the current 2026.10 schema. Files already at 2026.10 are left unchanged.

- From 2025.10: converts the legacy NaN-separated `mask` column (`List(Float32)`) to the nested `polygon` column (`List(List(Float32))`). A Binary raster `mask` column is left unchanged.
- From 2026.04: adds the `ignore` column from the deprecated `iscrowd` column and keeps `iscrowd` as a mirror.
- In both cases, sets the `schema_version` metadata to 2026.10.

**edgefirst-client migrate** \[*OPTIONS*\] *INPUT*

**Arguments:**

*INPUT*
:   Path to the input Arrow file.

**Options:**

`--output` *OUTPUT*
:   Output path. Defaults to overwriting the input file in place.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Migrate in place
edgefirst-client migrate dataset.arrow

# Migrate to a new file, preserving the original
edgefirst-client migrate dataset.arrow --output migrated.arrow
```

## VisDrone interchange

Convert the VisDrone2019 aerial detection benchmark (DET still images and VID video sequences) into the EdgeFirst Dataset Format. The converter is offline and needs no Studio credentials. Extract the official archives first; note that `VisDrone2019-DET-test-dev.zip` has no top-level folder, so extract it into a directory of your choosing and pass `--group test-dev`.

### `visdrone-to-arrow`

**edgefirst-client visdrone-to-arrow** \[*OPTIONS*\] `--output` *OUTPUT* *SPLIT_DIR*...

**Arguments:**

*SPLIT_DIR*
:   One or more extracted split directories. A DET split contains `annotations/<name>.txt` and `images/<name>.jpg`; a VID split contains `annotations/<seq>.txt` and `sequences/<seq>/0000001.jpg`. DET and VID splits may be combined into one output.

**Options:**

**-o, \--output** *OUTPUT*
:   Output annotation file (required). `.parquet` writes Apache Parquet, anything else writes Arrow IPC. File metadata carries `schema_version`, `labels` (the ten VisDrone object classes in `label_index` order) and `category_metadata`.

`--group` *GROUP*
:   Group applied to every sample. When omitted, the group is inferred from each directory name ending in `-train`, `-val`, `-test-dev` or `-test-challenge`, and conversion fails for any other name.

`--images`
:   Stage the split images into `<dir>/<stem>/` next to the output. DET images keep their names; VID frames are renamed to `<seq>/<seq>_<frame>.camera.jpeg` so `validate-snapshot` and `upload-dataset` resolve them.

`--link`
:   Symlink staged images instead of copying (Unix only; requires `--images`).

`--keep-ignored`
:   Keep VisDrone category 0 (`ignored regions`) and 11 (`others`) instead of dropping them. Category 0 becomes an unlabeled row flagged `ignore=true`; category 11 becomes an unlabeled row flagged `exclude=true`. Neither gets a `label` or `label_index`. Python: `keep_ignored=True`.

**Mapping:**

By default, categories 0 (`ignored regions`) and 11 (`others`) are dropped; the remaining ten classes are indexed `label_index = object_category - 1` (`pedestrian` = 0 … `motor` = 9), matching the Ultralytics VisDrone mapping. With `--keep-ignored`, categories 0 and 11 are kept as unlabeled rows flagged `ignore`/`exclude` (see below) instead of being dropped.

| VisDrone | EdgeFirst |
|---|---|
| `bbox_left, bbox_top, bbox_width, bbox_height` | `box2d` normalized `[cx, cy, w, h]` |
| `object_category` 1..10 | `label`, `label_index = object_category - 1` |
| `object_category` 0 (`ignored regions`) | dropped by default; with `--keep-ignored`, an unlabeled row with `ignore = true` |
| `object_category` 11 (`others`) | dropped by default; with `--keep-ignored`, an unlabeled row with `exclude = true` |
| `score` | not stored: it is 0 exactly when the category is 0 or 11 |
| `truncation`, `occlusion` | `truncation`, `occlusion` columns |
| VID `frame_index`, sequence | `frame`, `name` = sequence |
| VID `target_id` | `object_id` = `<seq>/<target_id>` |

**Examples:**

```bash
# DET train + val into one offline dataset
edgefirst-client visdrone-to-arrow VisDrone2019-DET-train VisDrone2019-DET-val \
  -o visdrone-det/visdrone-det.arrow --images
edgefirst-client validate-snapshot visdrone-det

# test-dev, extracted into a folder without a split suffix
edgefirst-client visdrone-to-arrow testdev -o visdrone-testdev/visdrone-testdev.parquet \
  --group test-dev --images

# VID val as a sequence dataset
edgefirst-client visdrone-to-arrow VisDrone2019-VID-val -o visdrone-vid/visdrone-vid.arrow --images

# DET val + VID train in one offline dataset (mixed splits)
edgefirst-client visdrone-to-arrow VisDrone2019-DET-val VisDrone2019-VID-train \
  -o visdrone-mixed/visdrone-mixed.arrow --images
```

Ignored regions and `others` are already dropped by default; filter to the train group directly with Polars:

```python
import polars as pl

df = pl.read_ipc("visdrone-det/visdrone-det.arrow")
train = df.filter(pl.col("group") == "train")
```

Rerun with `--keep-ignored` and filter on the flags instead of `label_index` if those rows are needed:

```python
df = pl.read_ipc("visdrone-det/visdrone-det.arrow")

## A split with no ignored regions or no others has no column for that flag.

flag_cols = [c for c in ("ignore", "exclude") if c in df.columns]
flagged = df.filter(pl.any_horizontal(flag_cols)) if flag_cols else df.clear()
```

**Studio notes (first pass):** `upload-dataset` publishes the converted dataset. Labels are created with `label_index` 0–9 (`pedestrian` = 0), groups follow the split names, VID frames become Studio sequences and `object_id` is stored as `object_reference`, so track ids survive. Rows flagged `ignore`/`exclude` (from `--keep-ignored`) are not uploaded, and `truncation` and `occlusion` are not stored by Studio yet; keep the Arrow file as the source of truth. Version tag restore drops per-annotation attributes.

**Source fidelity:** boxes are converted exactly as written in the VisDrone text files. A few extend past the image edge (34 boxes across the six official splits) and a few have zero height (3 boxes); they are kept, not clipped or dropped, so evaluation against the official protocol stays exact. Filter them in Polars if a trainer rejects them.

Retrieve validation session information for the provided session ID.

**edgefirst-client validation-session** *SESSION_ID*

**Arguments:**

*SESSION_ID*
:   The unique identifier of the validation session.

### `update-validation-session`

Update the name and/or description of a validation session. At least one of `--name` or `--description` must be provided.

**edgefirst-client update-validation-session** \[*OPTIONS*\] *SESSION_ID*

**Arguments:**

*SESSION_ID*
:   Validation session ID.

**Options:**

`--name` *NAME*
:   New session name.

`--description` *DESC*
:   New session description.

### `delete-validation-sessions`

Delete one or more validation sessions. Only the validation sessions are removed; the parent training session is never affected.

**edgefirst-client delete-validation-sessions** *SESSION_IDS*...

**Arguments:**

*SESSION_IDS*
:   One or more validation session IDs to delete.

**Example:**

```bash
edgefirst-client delete-validation-sessions v-5e6f v-7a8b
```

### `validator-schemas`

List the validator schemas available on the server. Each schema describes the parameters accepted by the matching validator type.

**edgefirst-client validator-schemas** \[`--type` *TYPE*\]

**Options:**

`--type` *TYPE*
:   Only show the schema with this type.

## Environment variables

**STUDIO_SERVER**
:   EdgeFirst Studio server name. Used when logging in or when no token is available. If a token exists with a different server, **STUDIO_SERVER** is ignored and a warning is displayed.

**STUDIO_USERNAME**
:   Username for authentication. Overridden by `--username` option.

**STUDIO_PASSWORD**
:   Password for authentication. Overridden by `--password` option.

**STUDIO_TOKEN**
:   Authentication token. The server is extracted from the token and takes priority over **STUDIO_SERVER**. Overridden by `--token` option.

**RUST_LOG**
:   Logging level (error, warn, info, debug, trace). Default: info.

**EDGEFIRST_UPLOAD_BATCHES**
:   Number of concurrent batch-upload tasks used by `upload-dataset`. Default: 4.

**MAX_TASKS**
:   General upload/download task concurrency (e.g. `download-snapshot`). Default: half the available CPU cores, clamped to the 2-8 range. Distinct from **EDGEFIRST_UPLOAD_BATCHES**.

## Token file locations

**~/.config/edgefirststudio/token** (Linux)
:   Cached authentication token for persistent sessions.

**~/Library/Application Support/ai.EdgeFirst.EdgeFirst-Studio/token** (macOS)
:   Cached authentication token for persistent sessions.

**%APPDATA%\\EdgeFirst\\EdgeFirst Studio\\config\\token** (Windows)
:   Cached authentication token for persistent sessions.

## Exit status

**0**
:   Success

**1**
:   General error (authentication failure, network error, invalid parameters)

**101**
:   Test failure (when running tests)

## Examples

### Authentication Workflow

```bash
# Login and cache token (prompts for username and password)

edgefirst-client --server test login

# Subsequent commands use cached token

edgefirst-client projects
```

### Alternative: Environment Variables

```bash
# Set credentials in environment

export STUDIO_SERVER=test
export STUDIO_USERNAME=user@example.com
export STUDIO_PASSWORD=secret

# Commands automatically use environment variables

edgefirst-client datasets
```

### Alternative: Token-Based Authentication

```bash
# Get token and store in environment

export STUDIO_TOKEN=$(edgefirst-client \
    --username user@example.com \
    --password secret \
    token)

# Use token for subsequent commands

edgefirst-client --token $STUDIO_TOKEN projects
```

### Dataset Management Workflow

```bash
# Create a new project dataset

DATASET_ID=$(edgefirst-client create-dataset 12345 "Q4 Training" \
    --description "Fourth quarter training data" | \
    grep -oP '\d+$')

# Create annotation set

ANNSET_ID=$(edgefirst-client create-annotation-set $DATASET_ID "Manual" \
    --description "Human-verified annotations" | \
    grep -oP '\d+$')

# Upload data

edgefirst-client upload-dataset $DATASET_ID \
    --annotations data.arrow \
    --images ./photos/ \
    --annotation-set-id $ANNSET_ID

# Download for verification

edgefirst-client download-dataset $DATASET_ID \
    --output ./verify/

# Clean up

edgefirst-client delete-annotation-set $ANNSET_ID
edgefirst-client delete-dataset $DATASET_ID
```

### Training Artifact Management

```bash
# List experiments and sessions

edgefirst-client experiments 12345
edgefirst-client training-sessions

# Get session details

edgefirst-client training-session t-1a2b --artifacts

# Download training artifacts

edgefirst-client download-artifact t-1a2b model.pth \
    --output ./models/

# Upload post-training artifacts

edgefirst-client upload-artifact t-1a2b ./analysis.json
```

### Monitoring Tasks

```bash
# List all running tasks with stages

edgefirst-client tasks --status running --stages

# Monitor specific task

watch -n 5 'edgefirst-client task 98765'
```

### Python API Integration (pip install)

```bash
# One install provides CLI + Python module

python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install edgefirst-client tqdm

edgefirst-client login
python examples/01_authentication.py
```

Hybrid CLI + Python workflow with the public Coffee Cup dataset (`ds-145f`):

```bash
# Inspect dataset

edgefirst-client dataset ds-145f --annotation-sets --labels

# Export annotations as Arrow, analyze in Python

edgefirst-client download-annotations <as-id> coffee_cup.arrow --groups val
python examples/04_polars_dataframe.py

# Download images

edgefirst-client download-dataset ds-145f --groups val --types image \
    --output ./coffee_cup_images/
```
