# Automatic Ground Truth Generation (AGTG)

AGTG allows datasets to have annotation populated on a dataset with minimal human interaction. There are two modes of operation

1. Background Operation: this is invoked at the time of importing the dataset
2. Semi-automatic: users can select portions of dataset sequenced and manually trigger AI assisted annotation
