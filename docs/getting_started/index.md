# Getting Started

Welcome to EdgeFirst Studio, this tutorial will walk you through the full end-to-end workflow.
Though not required, we urge you to follow along with an appropriate edge device to test the
models on the actual hardware.  If you don't have such a device, that's okay, we'll show you
how to run the models on a PC using the same applications and APIs you would be using on the
embedded device so you may get familiar with this environment.

If you have recently received one of these EdgeFirst Modules you may want to first start with
the EdgeFirst Modules Quickstart then come back once you're ready to get started with the
cloud tools.
