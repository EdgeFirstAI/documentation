# EdgeFirst Studio

Welcome to the EdgeFirst Studio documentation.  EdgeFirst Studio provides a full end-to-end suite for visual perception at the edge, on low-powered embedded devices.  We provide hardware modules, models, and middleware for visual AI processing on embedded devices plus cloud tooling for automated dataset creation, model training, and deployment back to the embedded devices.
