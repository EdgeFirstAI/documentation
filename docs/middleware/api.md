# API Reference

This is the reference manual for the EdgeFirst Middleware Schemas and dependencies.  The documentation
is generated from the Python API of the schemas, which includes the dependencies from ROS2 and Foxglove.
The Rust API is documented on [docs.rs/edgefirst-schemas](https://docs.rs/edgefirst-schemas/latest/edgefirst_schemas/).

We document all the schemas used by the EdgeFirst Middleware, including the upstream ones.  The source
code for all schemas currently in use are available from these three repositories.

- [EdgeFirst Schemas](https://github.com/EdgeFirstAI/schemas)
- [Foxglove Schemas](https://github.com/foxglove/schemas)
- [ROS2 Common Interfaces](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/tree/humble)

The topics documentation gives a breakdown of the available topics and the schemas they use, referencing them in this API Reference.
