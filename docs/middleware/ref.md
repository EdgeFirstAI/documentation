# API Reference

This section covers the topics provided by the EdgeFirst Middleware along with their schema definitions.
The complete schema definitions, including third-party schemas, are hosted on the EdgeFirstAI Github.

The documentation includes references to the EdgeFirst Middleware services which publish or subscribe to
these topics to help ensure the correct service is running on your platform in order to levarage the topic.
Some of these services have special hardware requirements, while the camera service requires a camera most
platforms should have on available.  Other services such as the Radar or LiDAR publisher services require
more specialty hardware to be integrated with your platform.  The Radar Publisher will work out of the box
on the Raivin platform while the LiDAR publisher requires a supported LiDAR sensor to be paired with the
platform.  We provide a LiDAR mounting kit for Maivin and Raivin platforms.
